## Overview
This directory contains problems that leverage the stack data structure
to manage state and nested relationships.

Stacks are widely used in parsing, expression evaluation, and validation
problems and are common in interview questions.

## Concepts Covered
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle
- Stack push/pop operations
- Matching pairs and nesting
- Using stacks for validation

## Problems Included
- Valid Parentheses

## Key Learnings
- Using stacks for structural validation
- Handling nested and sequential patterns
- Efficient space usage
