# Linked List

## Overview
This directory contains common linked list problems frequently asked in
technical interviews. Linked lists are fundamental for understanding
pointer manipulation and memory-efficient data structures.

## Concepts Covered
- Singly linked list structure
- Node traversal
- Pointer manipulation
- Iterative linked list operations

## Problems Included
- Reverse a Singly Linked List

## Key Learnings
- Safe pointer reassignment
- Iterative vs recursive approaches
- Handling edge cases (empty list, single node)
