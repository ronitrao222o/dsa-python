# Trees

## Overview
This directory focuses on basic tree data structures and traversal algorithms.
Tree-based problems are common in interviews and are fundamental to understanding
hierarchical data and recursive algorithms.

## Concepts Covered
- Binary tree structure
- Tree node representation
- Recursive traversal techniques

## Problems Included
- Inorder Traversal of a Binary Tree

## Key Learnings
- Traversing hierarchical data structures
- Applying recursion to tree problems
- Understanding depth-first traversal
