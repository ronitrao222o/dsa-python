# Recursion

## Overview
This directory contains problems solved using recursion, where a function
calls itself to break down a problem into smaller subproblems.

Recursion is commonly used in tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms,
and backtracking problems.

## Concepts Covered
- Base cases
- Recursive function calls
- Call stack behavior
- Problem decomposition

## Problems Included
- Factorial Calculation

## Key Learnings
- Identifying correct base cases
- Understanding recursive flow
- Avoiding infinite recursion
