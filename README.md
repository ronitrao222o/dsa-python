# Data Structures & Algorithms in Python

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of core data structures and algorithms
frequently tested in technical interviews, with a focus on clarity, correctness,
and time/space complexity analysis.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Hash Maps
- Recursion
- Trees
- Linked Lists
- Stacks


## Goals
- Build strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Write clean, readable, interview-ready code
- Analyze algorithmic complexity

Each solution includes an explanation and complexity analysis.
