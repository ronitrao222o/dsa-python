# Hash Maps

## Overview
This directory focuses on problems that use hash maps (dictionaries) to
optimize lookups and frequency counting.

Hash maps are a core data structure used extensively in backend systems
and are heavily tested in coding interviews.

## Concepts Covered
- Key-value storage
- Frequency counting
- Constant-time lookups
- Space vs time trade-offs

## Problems Included
- Frequency Counter

## Key Learnings
- Using hash maps to reduce time complexity
- Choosing appropriate data structures for fast access
- Writing scalable and efficient solutions
